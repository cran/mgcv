# All this catalog "translates" are quotation characters.
# The msgids must be ASCII and therefore cannot contain real quotation
# characters, only substitutes like grave accent (0x60), apostrophe (0x27)
# and double quote (0x22). These substitutes look strange; see
# http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html
#
# This catalog translates grave accent (0x60) and apostrophe (0x27) to
# left single quotation mark (U+2018) and right single quotation mark (U+2019).
# It also translates pairs of apostrophe (0x27) to
# left single quotation mark (U+2018) and right single quotation mark (U+2019)
# and pairs of quotation mark (0x22) to
# left double quotation mark (U+201C) and right double quotation mark (U+201D).
#
# When output to an UTF-8 terminal, the quotation characters appear perfectly.
# When output to an ISO-8859-1 terminal, the single quotation marks are
# transliterated to apostrophes (by iconv in glibc 2.2 or newer) or to
# grave/acute accent (by libiconv), and the double quotation marks are
# transliterated to 0x22.
# When output to an ASCII terminal, the single quotation marks are
# transliterated to apostrophes, and the double quotation marks are
# transliterated to 0x22.
