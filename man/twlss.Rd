\title{Tweedie location scale family}
\description{Tweedie family in which the mean, power and scale parameters can all depend on smooth linear predictors. Restricted to estimation via the extended Fellner Schall method of Wood and Fasiolo (2017). Only usable with \code{\link{gam}}. Tweedie distributions are exponential family with variance given by \eqn{\phi \mu^p}{s*m^p} where \eqn{\phi}{s} is a scale parameter, \eqn{p}{p} a parameter (here between 1 and 2) and \eqn{\mu}{m} is the mean. 
}

\usage{
twlss(link=list("log","identity","identity"),a=1.01,b=1.99)
}
\arguments{

\item{link}{The link function list: currently no choise.}

\item{a}{lower limit on the power parameter relating variance to mean.}

\item{b}{upper limit on power parameter.}

\value{
An object inheriting from class \code{general.family}.

\details{ A Tweedie random variable with 1<p<2 is a sum of \code{N} gamma random variables 
where \code{N} has a Poisson distribution. The p=1 case is a generalization of a Poisson distribution and is a discrete 
distribution supported on integer multiples of the scale parameter. For 1<p<2 the distribution is supported on the 
positive reals with a point mass at zero. p=2 is a gamma distribution. As p gets very close to 1 the continuous 
distribution begins to converge on the discretely supported limit at p=1, and is therefore highly multimodal. 
See \code{\link{ldTweedie}} for more on this behaviour.

The Tweedie density involves a normalizing constant with no closed form, so this is evaluated using the series 
evaluation method of Dunn and Smyth (2005), with extensions to also compute the derivatives w.r.t. \code{p} and the scale parameter. 
Without restricting \code{p} to (1,2) the calculation of Tweedie densities is more difficult, and there does not 
currently seem to be an implementation which offers any benefit over \code{\link{quasi}}. If you need  this 
case then the \code{tweedie} package is the place to start.
